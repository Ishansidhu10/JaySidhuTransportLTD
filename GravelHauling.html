            <p>
              Gravel Hauling Services are very integral to the construction
              industry. Whether it is for the construction of roads, or
              residential buildings, or commercial buildings, gravel is a much
              required product in the industry. It is either used on its own for
              paving roads, gardens, walkways, etc., or it is used as a
              composite with concrete in the construction of buildings. It is
              essential for gravel to be hauled from its place of origin to its
              destination as any delay in this could cause great delays in the
              completion of the project. For every project that has to be
              completed on time, Gravel Hauling Edmonton helps to make sure it
              is completed in a timely and cost effective manner.
            </p>
            <p>
              Jay Sidhu Transport Ltd., has a host of equipment, vehicles, and
              staff to ensure that Gravel Hauling Services are done effectively
              and successfully. The services we provided are all COR certified.
              We strictly follow the HSE (Health, Safety, and Environment)
              Program so that our employees are up to date with the latest in
              safety and health regulations. We complete all our projects in an
              environmentally friendly manner. We always maintain an open line
              of communication with our clients so they know exactly what is the
              progress of the project, how much work has been completed, and how
              much more needs to be done.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our vehicles are fitted with state-of-the-art GPS tracking
              features which make it easier to manage the logistics. This
              ensures that our Gravel Hauling Edmonton is always on time, every
              time. No matter what the scope of the hauling may be, whether it
              is for a small project or a more extensive one, our resources are
              always ready to take it on successfully. We also have the capacity
              to scale up operations on short notice, so even if you start off
              with small requirements for gravel hauling but later have to
              increase it, we can do so at very short notice without any
              complications and time delay to the project.
            </p>
