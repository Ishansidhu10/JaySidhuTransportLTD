            <p>
              Jay Sidhu Transport Ltd. is experienced and prepared to haul
              contaminated soil or slurry. We make a plan / procedure with the
              Contractor considering the details of the contaminated product,
              the volume and the transport route. We then proceed to obtaining
              the required documentation and precautionary items needed. We
              strive for the best plan to expedite removal of the contaminated
              product. Our goal is to ensure the removal/hauling is in
              compliance and is properly routed to the most cost-effective
              destination causing the least health and environmental concerns.
            </p>
            <p>
              Jay Sidhu Transport drivers/employees attend pre-project planning
              meetings and ongoing meetings or communications to remain aware of
              the situation. Daily Safety Meetings ensure the Drivers are
              reminded of the safety precautions and procedures as well as
              informed of the client expectations. We take pride in our work and
              strive to maintain our good reputation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hauling of contaminated soil has to be done in a very careful,
              professional, and scientific manner for maximum protection to the
              health of people around and for the safety of the environment.
              Contaminated soil is most often found in excavation sites or
              construction sites. It could either be dug up or treated above
              ground or it could be hauled for disposal at a landfill. Sometimes
              the contaminated soil may also impact the quality and safety of
              the groundwater, which makes it imperative to remove the
              contaminated soil as quickly and efficiently as possible without
              harm to people or the environment around.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our Contaminated Soil Hauling Edmonton services have been trusted
              for years because of the level of professionalism and reliability
              that we bring to the job. We have a wide range of equipment for
              hauling out the soil, depending on the requirements of the job. No
              matter what the amount of contaminated soil, we have the equipment
              and vehicles to get it out in time.
