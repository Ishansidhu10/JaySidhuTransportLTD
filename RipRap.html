              <h1>Rip Rap</h1>
            </header>

            <span class="image main"></span>

            <p>
              Riprap is called by many different names in the construction
              industry, such as shot rock, rubble, rock armour, etc. Basically a
              type of rock that is used to protect buildings that are near the
              shore from water exposure, ice exposure, and soil erosion, riprap
              is usually made from limestone or granite. Sometimes rubble from
              concrete from a demolition of pavements or buildings is also used
              to make riprap. It is used not just in shorelines, but in any
              surface where there is a waterway or place that is continually
              exposed to water, such as a water containment area.
            </p>
            <p>
              Riprap Hauling Services play an important part in ensuring that
              such projects get completed on time and within the budgetary
              limitations. If there is any delay in the hauling services, there
              would be an inordinate delay in the project also, resulting in
              loss of time and money for contractors. That is why it is very
              important to hire Riprap Hauling Edmonton services that are
              reliable, cost effective, professional, and timely for greatest
              project success.
            </p>
            <p>
              Riprap is very effective in absorbing water and keeping it from
              affecting the other parts of the surface. They both absorb and
              deflect water so it doesnâ€™t reach the areas that should be away
              from the water. They also protect against the damage caused by ice
              or other debris, which is why they are often used in the
              construction of supports for bridges.
            </p>
            <p>
              At Jay Sidhu Transport Ltd., we know how important it is for
              riprap to get to the site on time, every time. That is why we
              deploy our best equipment, vehicles, and personnel to haul riprap
              and get it delivered on time. Our fleet of state of the art
              vehicles and equipment is managed by professionals from start to
              finish.
            </p>
            <p>
